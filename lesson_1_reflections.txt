How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It quickly reduced the number of lines that could potentially have a problem
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you make mistakes you could restore previous versions easily and quickly
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: The saves are made at logical points and will compile if done properly. Cons: If you forget to make saves you do not have a parachute.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs is more designed for independent file development while Git was designed for people developing projects that contain multiple files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows each different commit as a snapshot of the file at a certain point in time and the git diff command compares two files and shows the differences between them.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I will always have older versions that i can fall back on.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Working on a project from start to finish.
